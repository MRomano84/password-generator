# Password-generator
## Description

This README is for the week 3 homework assignment through UNH's Coding Bootcamp. For the assignment, I am to create a password generator using Javascript that allows the user to choose between 4 character types (lower & upper case letters, numbers, and special characters) and give the option for a password length between 8 - 128 characters. 

## Process
I included an alert (modal) that pops up if the user unchecks all of the character types. It is defaulted to use all 4 character types and password length of 35 characters. The generator runs on a website so no installation is necessary.
